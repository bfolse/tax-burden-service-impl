== Improvements to specific tax calculations ==
Income tax calculation for many states includes tax credits, including
  Military, Child Care, Earned Income, Historic Preservation, First Responder, etc.
Income tax calculation for many states allows for exemptions of income from Social Security,
  unemployment, government bonds, active duty military. Also exemptions from political donations,
  college savings plans contributions. Consider adding these to tax payer profile.

PA income tax allows itemized deductions for only Med. Savings, Healthcare Savings, and 529 contributions. Need
  break down "Other itemized deductions" and "Pre tax contributions" further to have a more accurate calculation.
  Currently not using any exemptions or deductions in calculation.

PA local income tax - problems with multiple political divisions named 'Franklin' there are several, each
  in a different county. Need to resolve this. Also: 'Union', 'Lancaster'

AL income tax has standard deductions that vary based on income. Income ranges only from $0-15,000 for SINGLE
  and $0-30,000 for married, so current solution is to always use max standard deduction.

AR (and maybe other states) exempts active duty military income and gives exemptions, enlisted and retired
military personnel receive exemptions
  Tax credits for filer and dependents, % of child care expenses

CT income tax has personal exemption that varies based on income.  Current solution is to
  use average personal exemption of $2000 for single, married-separate, HOH, and $4000 for joint

MD income tax has exemption amount that varies based on income.  Current solution is to use amount
  for most common bracket: $3200 for single income less than $100,000 or joint less than $150,000.
  Standard deduction is 15% of AGI with minimum and maximum dependent on filing status. Current solution
  is to use average of $2000 and $3000.

MI has standard deduction only for those 67 years of age or older

MN state income tax has a phase-out of itemized deductions based on taxable income. Current solution
  is to ignore and include all itemized deductions.

MT state income tax has standard deduction of 20% of AGI with minimum and maximum.  Maximum is low.
  Current solution is to use maximums since they would apply for taxpayers with median state income.

NE state income has a personal exemption credit of $134.

OH state income has bracketed (3 brackets) exemption amount based on AGI. Current solution is
  to use value from middle bracket, $2050 for personal and dependent.

RI state income phases out stardard deductions and exemptions for high income earners, starting
  at $199,000.  Current solution ignores this.

SC state income allows dependent exemption only for those 6 years and younger.  Current solution
  has no dependent exemption.

AL city sales tax - districts for:
  "Spanish Fort East Shore District" and "Spanish Fort Town Center District",
  "Tallassee with Elmore County" and "Tallassee within Tallapoosa County"
