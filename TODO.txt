WHERE ST_Contains(geom, ST_PointFromText('POINT(-84.3330 33.7536)', 4326));

SELECT name, statefp, countyfp, name

Income tax calculation for many states includes tax credits, including
  Military, Child Care, Earned Income, Historic Preservation, First Responder, etc.
PA income tax allows itemized deductions for only Med. Savings, Healthcare Savings, and 529 contributions. Need
  break down "Other itemized deductions" and "Pre tax contributions" further to have a more accurate calculation.
  Currently not using any exemptions or deductions in calculation.

AL income tax has standard deductions that vary based on income. Income ranges only from $0-15,000 for SINGLE
  and $0-30,000 for married, so current solution is to always use max standard deduction.

AR (and maybe other states) exempts active duty military income and gives exemptions, enlisted and retired
military personnel receive exemptions
  Tax credits for filer and dependents, % of child care expenses

CT income tax has personal exemption that varies based on income.  Current solution is to
  use average personal exemption of $2000 for single, married-separate, HOH, and $4000 for joint
